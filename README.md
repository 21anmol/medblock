![MedBlock](https://via.placeholder.com/800x200.png?text=MedBlock:+Decentralized+Healthcare+Records)

MedBlock is a decentralized healthcare record system that integrates blockchain technology, machine learning, and zero-knowledge proofs to provide secure, private, and efficient management of electronic health records (EHR).

## Features

- üîê **Blockchain-Based Security**: Immutable storage of medical records on the blockchain
- üß† **Machine Learning Analytics**: Fraud detection, predictive health analytics, and anomaly detection
- üîí **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Privacy-preserving data sharing
- üë• **Role-Based Access Control**: Granular access management for patients, providers, and insurers
- üì± **Modern UI**: React-based frontend for intuitive user experience

## Overview

MedBlock addresses the key challenges in healthcare record management:

1. **Security**: Using blockchain to ensure tamper-proof record storage
2. **Privacy**: Implementing zero-knowledge proofs for private data sharing
3. **Interoperability**: Creating a standardized system for healthcare data exchange
4. **Accessibility**: Providing patients with ownership and control of their data
5. **Analytics**: Leveraging machine learning for improved healthcare outcomes

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 14+
- PostgreSQL (optional, SQLite works for development)
- Web3 provider (like Ganache for development)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/medblock.git
   cd medblock
   ```

2. Install Python dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

4. Initialize the database:
   ```
   python -c "from database.models import init_db; init_db()"
   ```

5. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```
   cd frontend
   npm install
   cd ..
   ```

### Running the Application

1. Start the API server:
   ```
   python run.py
   ```

2. In a separate terminal, start the frontend development server:
   ```
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

3. Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`

## Architecture

MedBlock follows a modular architecture with the following components:

- **Backend API**: Flask-based REST API
- **Database**: SQLAlchemy ORM with SQLite/PostgreSQL
- **Blockchain Integration**: Web3.py for smart contract interaction
- **Machine Learning Models**: Scikit-learn and TensorFlow-based models
- **Frontend**: React with Material-UI

## Machine Learning Models

MedBlock includes three key ML models:

1. **Fraud Detection**: Identifies potentially fraudulent insurance claims
2. **Predictive Healthcare**: Predicts health risks based on patient data
3. **Anomaly Detection**: Detects unusual access patterns for security
